## Downloading Images (ACIs)

[aci-images]: https://github.com/appc/spec/blob/master/SPEC.md#app-container-image
[appc-discovery]: https://github.com/appc/spec/blob/master/SPEC.md#app-container-image-discovery

Rocket runs containers packaged as [Application Container Images (ACI)][aci-images] an open-source specification. ACIs consist of the root filesystem of the container, a manifest and an optional signature.

ACIs are named with a URL-like structure. This naming scheme allows for a decentralized discovery of ACIs, related signatures and public keys. Rocket uses these hints to execute [meta discovery][appc-discovery].

### rkt trust

Before executing a remotely fetched container, Rocket will verify it based on attached signatures generated by the ACI creator.

Before this can happen, Rocket needs to know which creators you trust, and therefore are trusted to run containers on your machine. The identity of each ACI creator is established with a public key, which is placed in Rocket's key store on disk.

When adding a trusted key, a prefix can scope the level of established trust to a subset of containers. A few examples:

```
$rkt trust --prefix storage.coreos.com
```

```
$rkt trust --prefix coreos.com/etcd
```

To trust a key for an entire root domain, you must use the `--root` flag.

```
$rkt trust --root coreos.com
```

#### Trust a Key Using Meta Discovery

The easiest way to trust a key is through meta discovery. Rocket will find and download a public key that the creator has published on their website. This process is detailed in the [Application Container specification][appc-discovery]. The TL;DR is Rocket will find a meta tag that looks like:

```
<meta name="ac-discovery-pubkeys" content="coreos.com/etcd https://coreos.com/dist/pubkeys/aci-pubkeys.gpg">
```

And use it to download the public key and present it to you for approval:

```
$ rkt trust --prefix coreos.com/etcd
Prefix: "coreos.com/etcd"
Key: "https://coreos.com/dist/pubkeys/aci-pubkeys.gpg"
GPG key fingerprint is: 8B86 DE38 890D DB72 9186  7B02 5210 BD88 8818 2190
  CoreOS ACI Builder <release@coreos.com>
Are you sure you want to trust this key (yes/no)? yes
Trusting "https://coreos.com/dist/pubkeys/aci-pubkeys.gpg" for prefix "coreos.com/etcd".
Added key for prefix "coreos.com/etcd" at "/etc/rkt/trustedkeys/prefix.d/coreos.com/etcd/8b86de38890ddb7291867b025210bd8888182190"
```

If Rocket can't find a key using meta discovery, an error will be printed:

```
$ rkt trust --prefix coreos.com                     
Error determining key location: --prefix meta discovery error: found no ACI meta tags
```

#### Trust a Key From Specific Location

If you know where a public key is located, you can request it directly from disk or via HTTPS:

```
$ sudo ./rkt trust --prefix coreos.com/etcd https://coreos.com/dist/pubkeys/aci-pubkeys.gpg
Prefix: "coreos.com/etcd"
Key: "https://coreos.com/dist/pubkeys/aci-pubkeys.gpg"
GPG key fingerprint is: 8B86 DE38 890D DB72 9186  7B02 5210 BD88 8818 2190
  CoreOS ACI Builder <release@coreos.com>
Are you sure you want to trust this key (yes/no)? yes
Trusting "https://coreos.com/dist/pubkeys/aci-pubkeys.gpg" for prefix "coreos.com/etcd".
Added key for prefix "coreos.com/etcd" at "/etc/rkt/trustedkeys/prefix.d/coreos.com/etcd/8b86de38890ddb7291867b025210bd8888182190"
```

#### Pre-Populating Trusted Keys on Disk

Trusted public keys can be pre-populated by placing them in the appropriate location on disk for the desired prefix.

_Depends on https://github.com/coreos/rocket/issues/500_
```
$ ls -l /etc/rkt/trustedkeys/
[insert example of root key vs prefixed key]
```

### rkt fetch

Rocket uses HTTPS to locate and download remote ACIs and their attached signatures. If the ACI exists locally, it won't be re-downloaded.

#### Fetch with Meta Discovery

The easiest way to fetch an ACI is through meta discovery. Rocket will find and download the ACI and signature from a location that the creator has published on their website. This process is detailed in the [Application Container specification][appc-discovery].

If you have previously trusted the container creator, it will be downloaded and verified: 

```
$ rkt fetch coreos.com/etcd:v2.0.0
rkt: searching for app image coreos.com/etcd:v2.0.0
rkt: fetching image from https://github.com/coreos/etcd/releases/download/v2.0.0/etcd-v2.0.0-linux-amd64.aci
Downloading aci: [=======================================      ] 3.25 MB/3.7 MB
Downloading signature from https://github.com/coreos/etcd/releases/download/v2.0.0/etcd-v2.0.0-linux-amd64.sig
rkt: signature verified: 
  CoreOS ACI Builder <release@coreos.com>
sha512-fa1cb92dc276b0f9bedf87981e61ecde
```

If you haven't trusted the creator, it will be downloaded but not verified:

```
$ sudo ./rkt fetch coreos.com/etcd:v2.0.0
rkt: searching for app image coreos.com/etcd:v2.0.0
rkt: fetching image from https://github.com/coreos/etcd/releases/download/v2.0.0/etcd-v2.0.0-linux-amd64.aci
Downloading aci: [=======================================      ] 3.25 MB/3.7 MB
Downloading signature from https://github.com/coreos/etcd/releases/download/v2.0.0/etcd-v2.0.0-linux-amd64.sig
rkt: fetching image from https://github.com/coreos/etcd/releases/download/v2.0.0/etcd-v2.0.0-linux-amd64.aci
sha512-fa1cb92dc276b0f9bedf87981e61ecde
```

#### Fetch from Specific Location

If you already know where an image is stored, you can fetch it directly:

```
$ rkt fetch https://github.com/coreos/etcd/releases/download/v2.0.0/etcd-v2.0.0-linux-amd64.aci
rkt: fetching image from https://github.com/coreos/etcd/releases/download/v2.0.0/etcd-v2.0.0-linux-amd64.aci
Downloading aci: [=======================================      ] 3.25 MB/3.7 MB
Downloading signature from https://github.com/coreos/etcd/releases/download/v2.0.0/etcd-v2.0.0-linux-amd64.sig
rkt: fetching image from https://github.com/coreos/etcd/releases/download/v2.0.0/etcd-v2.0.0-linux-amd64.aci
sha512-fa1cb92dc276b0f9bedf87981e61ecde
```
